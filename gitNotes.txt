 

when in the root directory of a project, you can create a git repository using the command
    $ git init

set your user details in orderr to commit changes. 
    $ git config --global user.name "nathanael joseph"
    $ git config --global user.email "nathanaeljy@outlook.com"

Check which files have been staged, which have been commited, and which are not being tracked:
    $ git status

Add the unstaged files
    $ git add [filename]
You can add all files using
    $ git add *

Commit staged changes with 
    $ git commit -m "the commit message"
commit messages should follow the convention "this commit will [message]"
Staged changes are commited to the current branch, which is "master" by default.

to check the changes made
    $ git diff
to check the staged changes, use:
    $ git diff --staged

to remove a file from the working directory and stage the deletion:
    $ git rm [filename]
then commit the deletion.
